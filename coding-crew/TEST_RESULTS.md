## Conclusion

**Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR USE**

The web interface for human approval is fully implemented and tested. All core functionality works correctly:

1. **Analysis Submission** - CrewAI can submit analyses for approval
2. **Human Review** - Web interface displays analyses with professional styling
3. **Approval Workflow** - Humans can approve/reject with feedback
4. **Workflow Integration** - CrewAI waits for approval before proceeding

The system successfully provides the human-in-the-loop approval mechanism required by the project specification.
