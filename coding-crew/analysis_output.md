# Simple Calculator API System Design
=====================================

## Executive Summary
-------------------

This document outlines the system design for a simple calculator API that supports basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The system will consist of a frontend, backend, database, and API gateway. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable.

## Detailed Requirements Breakdown
---------------------------------

### Functional Requirements

*   Users can perform basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using the calculator API.
*   The API will accept user input in the form of mathematical expressions.
*   The API will return the result of the mathematical expression as a response.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   The system must be scalable to handle a large number of users.
*   The system must be secure to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   The system must be maintainable to ensure easy updates and bug fixes.

## System Architecture Design
-----------------------------

The system architecture will consist of the following components:

### Frontend

*   User Interface: A simple user interface that allows users to input mathematical expressions.
*   State Management: A state management system that stores user input and session data.
*   Routing: A routing mechanism that directs user requests to the correct API endpoint.
*   Authentication UI: An authentication user interface that handles user login and registration.

### Backend

*   Business Logic: The business logic layer that performs mathematical operations on user input.
*   API Endpoints: API endpoints that handle user requests and return responses.
*   Authentication: An authentication mechanism that verifies user credentials.
*   Data Validation: A data validation system that checks user input for errors.

### Database

*   User Data: A database table that stores user information (username, password, etc.).
*   Task Storage: A database table that stores mathematical expressions and results.
*   Session Management: A session management system that stores user session data.
*   Audit Logs: A database table that stores audit logs for security purposes.

### API Gateway

*   The API gateway will act as an entry point for all user requests.
*   It will direct user requests to the correct backend endpoint based on the request type (e.g., math operation).

*   Database: PostgreSQL for a robust and secure database solution.
*   API Gateway: NGINX for a high-performance and scalable API gateway.

### Component Details

```
Frontend: [User Interface, State Management, Routing, Authentication UI]
Backend: [Business Logic, API Endpoints, Authentication, Data Validation] 
Database: [User Data, Task Storage, Session Management, Audit Logs]
```

### Data Flow Steps

```
User Input -> Frontend -> API Gateway -> Backend -> Database
Database -> Backend -> API Gateway -> Frontend -> User Display
```

Here is the draw.io XML diagram for the system architecture:
